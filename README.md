# Projects using EPSTEIN FILES 20K 

A curated collection of community projects built using the [EPSTEIN_FILES_20K dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tensonaut/EPSTEIN_FILES_20K) from Hugging Face.

## About the Dataset

In Novemeber 12, 2025 approximately 20,000+ pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein were released by the House Oversight Committee. These documents were subsequently organized, processed to create a single dataset and uploaded to Hugging Face, making them accessible for analysis and exploration. The file can be found here

The dataset quickly gained attention across social media platforms including Reddit, Twitter, and Hugging Face itself, inspiring developers and researchers to build various tools for analyzing and navigating this massive collection of documents.
