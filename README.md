## Important Context

This repository catalogs tools for analyzing 20,000+ pages of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on November 12, 2024. These documents contain evidence related to serious criminal activities with real victims.

**Critical Warnings:**
- These documents involve real crimes and real victims
- All analysis must respect victim privacy and dignity
- Findings require rigorous verification against source documents
- AI-generated analyses can contain errors or false information
- This is not a typical data science project - approach with appropriate gravity

## Purpose

These tools aim to support:
- Professional journalists conducting investigations
- Legal researchers analyzing evidence
- Academic researchers with institutional oversight
- Transparency and accountability efforts

## Verification Requirements

**⚠️ MANDATORY**: AI tools can hallucinate facts, miss critical information, or misinterpret documents. 

**Before accepting any finding as fact:**
1. Verify against original source documents
2. Cross-check with multiple analysis methods
3. Confirm through independent sources
4. Report errors immediately to the [Safety repository](https://github.com/EF20K/Safety/issues/)

## Getting Started

For researchers new to the dataset:
- **[Getting_Started_w_Dataset.ipynb](Getting_Started_w_Dataset.ipynb)** - Basic exploration with emphasis on verification

#### [Epstein Email Threads Dataset](https://github.com/notesbymuneeb/epstein-emails)
A structured dataset derived from our source materials that extracts and parses **5,082 email threads** containing **16,447 individual messages**. The dataset uses LLM-based extraction to separate individual messages within threads, extract structured metadata (senders, recipients, timestamps, subjects), and clean message bodies. Available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/notesbymuneeb/epstein-emails).
