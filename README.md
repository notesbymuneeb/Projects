## About This Project

On November 12, 2025, the U.S. House Oversight Committee released over 20,000 pages of documents from the Epstein estate. This repository catalogs community-developed tools designed to support transparent, responsible analysis of these public records.

> **These documents involve real crimes and real victims.**  
> All work must respect victim privacy and dignity. This is not a typical data science project—approach with appropriate gravity.

## Intended Use

These tools are designed to support:

- Professional journalists conducting investigations
- Legal researchers analyzing evidence
- Academic researchers operating under institutional oversight
- Transparency and public accountability efforts

---

## Verification Requirements

> ⚠️ **Mandatory for all users**

AI-powered tools can hallucinate facts, omit critical context, or misinterpret documents. Before treating any finding as fact:

1. **Verify** against original source documents
2. **Cross-check** using multiple analysis methods
3. **Corroborate** through independent sources
4. **Report errors** immediately via the [Safety Repository](https://github.com/EF20K/Safety/issues/)
